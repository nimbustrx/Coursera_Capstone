    "For this Capstone Project, I will be leveraging the Foursquare location data in order to determine optimal places to open a Japanese Restaurant in the Houston Area. I will be looking at specific neighborhoods in the area to determine whether a neighborhood is viable by comparing the variety of venues available, as well as the amount of competition for Japanese Restaurants. This will serve as a great demonstration on the use of the Foursquare API in order to solve business problems.\n"

With this information, I hope to be able to group neighborhoods into clusters with similar venue makeup, and analyzing which clusters are able to sustain a new Japanese Restaurant.\n",
